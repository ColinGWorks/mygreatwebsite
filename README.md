## Some Log of Random Thoughts
- **Algorithm** Want to design a fast algorithm, given an array of key strings, and one input string, find the first matching key for the input string.
- **To-Study** When learning the totoally new topic, the time spent is most fruteful. New topic should be worthwhile though, like FPGA & RISC-V.
- **Cool-Do** Want to use a MD document to create an mind-map for all the knowledge and notes for the topics that I am required to master.

## Text Playground for Experimenting with *Markdown*
Experiment for Latex support: \(E=mc^2\)
> Latex is a great document formatting language that was invented by reknowned computer scientist *Don Knuth*. It is very strong in describing in plain text of formatting mathmatical formulae.

Now I have text that is outside of the example of definition with *Markdown* language. Simple equations can be formatted with subscripts and superscripts: *E*~0~=*mc*^2^.

Currently I found this [online editor](https://upmath.me) which supports *Markdown* and *Latex* integration. I can write a block of *Latex* text in it, making sure it is correct and then copy-paste it here, as this site supports saving into my *GitHub* account. Here is one example of inclusion of matrix.

$$T^{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon&0&0&0\\
0&\varepsilon/3&0&0\\
0&0&\varepsilon/3&0\\
0&0&0&\varepsilon/3
\end{pmatrix}.$$

And here is another try:
![ChaoLatexImage1](//tex.s2cms.ru/svg/%24%24T%5E%7B%5Cmu%5Cnu%7D%3D%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A%5Cvarepsilon%260%260%260%5C%5C%0A0%26%5Cvarepsilon%2F3%260%260%5C%5C%0A0%260%26%5Cvarepsilon%2F3%260%5C%5C%0A0%260%260%26%5Cvarepsilon%2F3%0A%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D.%24%24)
This is achieved by just using this pure [*Latex* online editor](https://tex.s2cms.com). **My thought:** I really think this website is very useful toegether with hackmd.io, and here is another example of showning a general matrix:
![ChaoLatexImage2](https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/A_%7Bm%2Cn%7D%20%3D%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A%20a_%7B1%2C1%7D%20%26%20a_%7B1%2C2%7D%20%26%20%5Ccdots%20%26%20a_%7B1%2Cn%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20a_%7B2%2C1%7D%20%26%20a_%7B2%2C2%7D%20%26%20%5Ccdots%20%26%20a_%7B2%2Cn%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%5Cvdots%20%20%26%20%5Cvdots%20%20%26%20%5Cddots%20%26%20%5Cvdots%20%20%5C%5C%0A%20a_%7Bm%2C1%7D%20%26%20a_%7Bm%2C2%7D%20%26%20%5Ccdots%20%26%20a_%7Bm%2Cn%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D).
(Note: For this second example, I add ```https:``` to the image insert's URL part, and when I export the result document, the image of *Latex* rendering shows up.)
